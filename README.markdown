Extension library provading CRUD functionality to ZF based application.

This is my play with Zend Framework inspired by [Batman](https://github.com/wilgucki/) and based on his [UniversalZF](https://github.com/wilgucki/UniversalZF)

Installation.
Clone repository under your 'library' directory and name it 'Crud'
